# MongoDB $in Operator with Null Values

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when dealing with arrays containing `null` values.

## Problem Description

When using the `$in` operator with an array that includes `null`, MongoDB's behavior might not be intuitive and could lead to unexpected results. The query might not return all documents that satisfy the condition, or it might throw an error depending on the MongoDB version and settings.

## Solution

To solve this, check if there are null values in the array passed to $in operator.  If you need to search for documents where the field is either one of the specified values or null, use the $in operator and add a separate condition for null values using the $or operator, or add a null value to the array.
